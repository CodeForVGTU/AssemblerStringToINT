# AssemblerStringToINT
## Convert number with type of String to INT Type

This application only works on Microsoft Visual Studio, because of assembler syntax!

String is passed as argument then starting the application and then converted to INT by assembler commands.

## Main parts of Algorithm:
- Reading one by one char from the string.
- Multiplying by 10 to move position (work with other numbers)
- Substracting 48 from char to get INT.
- Adding all together.
